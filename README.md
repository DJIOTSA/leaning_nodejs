# leaning_nodejs

This repository is for my Node.js learning journey. It includes examples, exercises, and small projects to practice core Node.js concepts such as asynchronous programming, building web servers, working with npm, and more. The goal is to build a solid foundation in Node.js through hands-on practice.


# Features:

- Basic Node.js scripts and exercises
- Building and deploying simple web servers
- Practice with core Node.js modules (fs, http, path, etc.)
- Hands-on examples with asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Project examples showcasing different Node.js use cases (e.g., RESTful APIs, file handling)
- Organized learning path with clear progression from beginner to intermediate concepts


# Goals:

- Gain a solid understanding of Node.js fundamentals
- Build practical applications using Node.js
- Document the learning process for future reference
- Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the code for your own learning purposes!
